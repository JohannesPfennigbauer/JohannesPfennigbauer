Greetings! 👋 
I'm Johannes, a nature enthusiast and data science student currently delving into the realms of coding. 
Here's a glimpse into who I am and what you can expect from my GitHub:

## About Me

🙂 **Pronouns**: He/Him </br>
📈 **Background**: With a bachelor's degree in mathematics, I've laid a solid foundation to master my Masters in Data Science and achieve my academic and personal goals. </br>
🌱 **Interests Beyond Coding**: When I'm not engrossed in coding, you'll often find me in the great outdoors. Either out in the fields farming or at home in the workshop engaged in crafting activities. Hiking is also a cherished  activity that helps me find balance amidst the regular desktop grind. </br>
🎨 **Side Projects**: As a delightful side project, I indulge in web design and graphics, transforming my passion into a hobby and a business that brings me immense joy and creative fulfillment.

## My Coding Passions

🔮 **Machine Learning and AI**: Whether experimenting with pre-trained models or building them from scratch, it is always a pleasure to use Python for data analysis and predictive modelling. What I love most are the unforeseen insights and outcomes from complex data that can be achieved with machine learning models. </br>
📱 **App Development**: My journey of learning and mastering app development has just started. However, I am on a good way to publish my first projects in the near future. Stay tuned! </br>
🎛️ **Interactive Dashboards**: Data visualisation with user interaction, aiming to create engaging and informative dashboards that tell compelling stories, combines both my interests in development and design in the most beautiful way.
